            <h3>I keen on ...</h3>

            <p>
                So, what can I say about that... lemme think. I keen on skiing, 
                probably it's my favourite activity ;) Also I love playing ( and 
                watchin') volleyball and basketball. But of course I am not such&nbsp; a
                sport person as it could look ;) I'm pretty lazy, sarcastic and 
                ( in my opinion)a little dumb xF. What's more I'm interested in 
                computers ( &lt;3 ), games of course and I'm tryin', as I said 
                before, learn sth new. Anime and manga, fantasy books are also 
                my things.

                to ind of MOBA games. I usually play on Midlane, sometimes
                in the jungle xF. My beloved champ is Yasuo ( cancered ).
                I tryin' to do my best ;) FPS and MMO RPG, that's what I
